                            </div>
                            <p>The Sternenko Community Foundation is a logical continuation of our volunteer efforts. For years, our community has been raising billions of hryvnias to supply Ukraine’s frontline with FPV drones, naval drones, and other essential equipment.</p>
                            <p>As the scale of support expanded, we realized the need for a more structured and efficient approach. That’s why we created the foundation — to mobilize additional resources, build lasting partnerships, and respond faster to the needs of our defenders. Since then, our impact has only grown.</p>

                            <p>No. Every donation made for the army goes directly to the frontlines and gets converted into FPV drones and other equipment urgently needed by the Defense Forces. We don't use donations intended for our defenders to cover our salaries or office costs.</p>
                            <p>Our operational needs are covered separately through dedicated contributions from partners and private donors.</p>

                            <p>We supply frontline military units with FPV drones — highly effective means for eliminating enemy equipment, personnel, and even russian drones and UAVs. We also assist selected units with gear for special operations at sea and behind enemy lines.</p>

                            <p>Not at this time. Currently, we focus exclusively on supporting the Ukrainian Defense Forces with FPV drones and equipment.In the future, we may expand our mission, but for now, our defenders remain our top priority.</p>

                            <p>Yes — but there are important conditions. We do provide drones without formal paperwork from military units, but only when we’re confident the unit truly needs them, knows how to use them, and will use them effectively.</p>
                            <p><b>We also require sufficient reports.</b> Units that receive drones must confirm delivery and demonstrate their use. If a unit does not report, we won’t continue providing support. This helps to ensure transparency, efficient use of resources, and the maximum possible impact on the battlefield.</p>
